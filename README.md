# Heart Disease Prediction - Logistic Regression Model
---
# This project implements a logistic regression model to predict heart disease outcomes based on clinical features such as age, gender, heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, CK-MB, and troponin levels. The dataset used contains no null values, ensuring clean and reliable input for model training.
